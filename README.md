# Overview

This software is for processing csv file. there are 2 main functions, calculating statistics and generating new columns. I wrote this software to learn R language and to practice writing code in R language. The software loads a csv file and processes the file. The software can calcualte statistical values for columns such as a sum, average, min, max, mean, ect. The software can also calculate new columns based on the existing columns such as a new column that is the sum of 2 columns.

# Development Environment

I used RStudio for this project to setup and install dependencies. I used R language to write the code.
I then switched to Visual Studio Code to write the code and run the code in the terminal because I am more familiar with Visual Studio Code.

R language is used for this project. I did not need to use any libraries for this project. R language has built-in functions to read and write csv files.
